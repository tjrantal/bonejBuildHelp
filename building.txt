Required tools to build BoneJ:
Java SDK (obviously)
Git (git-scm.com/)
Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/, e.g. TortoiseSVN works for windows)
Perl (http://www.perl.org)
Ant (http://ant.apache.org/, remember to add JAVA_HOME ANT_HOME and ANT_HOME/bin to your path)

download libraries BoneJ depends on to the same folder you have downloaded BoneJ source to, i.e.
rootFolder	-|- BoneJ
		 |- imagej
		 |-j3d-core			
		 |-j3d-core-utils	
		 |-vecmath		
		 |-junit
			 
Compile ImageJ with ant, i.e. cd to imagej folder and run "ant" from command line, wait ~30 s and build should finish.
Compile vecmath with ant, i.e. cd to vecmath folder and run "ant". N.B. ant is run in a folder with build.xml -file in it.
Compile j3d-core similarly with ant, which also builds the j3d-core-utils. N.B. j3d-core depends on vecmath, which needs to be compiled first. If you svn'd with tortoise, the default paths in j3d-core build.xml to j3d-core-utils and vecmath are incorret. Either copy the trunk folder contents to the folders as indicated above, or edit build.xml in j3d-core~svn/trunk folder to correct paths, i.e. lines that read:
	<property name="vecmath_home" location="../vecmath"/>
	<property name="core_utils_home" location="../j3d-core-utils"/>
to:
	<property name="vecmath_home" location="../../vecmath~svn/trunk"/>
	<property name="core_utils_home" location="../../j3d-core-utils~svn/trunk"/>
Compile junit with ant

Check that the paths in BoneJ folder build.xml match the paths on your computer. N.B. junit path is almost certainly incorrect, as it uses snapshot version number in the file name as default. I did not compile junit, ImageJ_3D_Viewer or imglib from source, but rather used pre-compiled jars. imglib.jar and ImageJ_3D_Viewer.jar resided in the root folder and junit.jar in junit -folder.

Finally, run ant in BoneJ folder and you're done. N.B. I had to download Skeletonize3d.java form http://code.google.com/p/objectj/source/browse/trunk/ObjectJ/src/ij/plugin/filter/Skeletonize3D.java?r=1114 to imagej/ij/plugin/filter for a successfull BoneJ compilation (obviously imagej needed to be recompiled prior to repeating bonej build).

JAVA 3D COMPILATION NOTES

JPEG encoder has become deprecated in java 7.
j3d-core-utils/src/classes/share/com/sun/j3d/utils/scenegraph/io/state/javax/media/j3d/ImageComponentState.java needs to be patched (took the patch from)
http://www.mail-archive.com/pkg-java-commits@lists.alioth.debian.org/msg10446.html

Also, I needed to modify j3d-core/src/native/build.xml for j3d-core native javahGen compilation to include vecmath classpath to compile.

I created a patch file: patch_j3d_java7.patch
Once you've svn'd the sources to

root	-|- j3d-core
	 |- j3d-core-utils

apply the patch in root folder (don't know how this would be done in windows -> take a look at the patch file and apply the changes manually)
patch -p1 < /path/to/patch_j3d_java7.patch

INSTALLATION TO YOUR JAVA JDK:
copy vecmath.jar, j3d-core.jar and j3d-core-utils.jar to {path/to/jdk}/jre/lib/ext and libj3dcore-ogl.so  to {path/to/jdk}/jre/lib/ext/amd64 (this being for 64 bit linux)
